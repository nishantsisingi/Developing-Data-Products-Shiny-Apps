# Developing-Data-Products-Shiny-Apps

The demo makes use of the Old Faithful Geyser data.  
  
Format   
A data frame with 272 observations on 2 variables.

eruptions - Eruption time in mins  
waiting - Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)  

For the sake of simplicity we would be using only the first variable "eruptions"

The project's objective is to plot a histogram using this dataset by choosing the number of bins for the first variable, eruptions - Eruption time in mins
